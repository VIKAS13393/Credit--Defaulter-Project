# Credit--Defaulter-Project
 Today, microfinance is widely accepted as a poverty-reduction tool, representing $70 billion in outstanding loans and a global outreach of 200 million clients. We are working with one such client that is in Telecom Industry. They are a fixed wireless telecommunications network provider  They are collaborating with an MFI to provide micro-credit on mobile balances to be paid back in 5 days. The Consumer is believed to be defaulter if he deviates from the path of paying back the loaned amount within the time duration of 5 days. For the loan amount of 5 (in Indonesian Rupiah), payback amount should be6(in Indonesian Rupiah), while, for the loan amount of 10(in Indonesian Rupiah), the payback amount should be 12(in Indonesian Rupiah).
